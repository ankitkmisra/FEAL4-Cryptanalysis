# FEAL4-Cryptanalysis

This work was completed as part of a course project for CS 406 (Cryptography and Network Security), titled 'Cryptanalysis of Block Ciphers'. In this project, we cover the foundations of differential and linear cryptanalysis, and apply them to the FEAL-4 cipher. We also implement the differential cryptanalytic attack.

Authors: Ankit Kumar Misra (190050020) and Kartikey Gupta (190050044).

`AttackOnFEAL4.cpp` contains an implementation of the FEAL-4 cipher along with a differential cryptanalytic attack on the cipher. The other two files included here are our final report and presentation.
